### Secret keys
Secret keys are not commited. Before compile :
1) rename `example.secret.ts` to `secret.ts` of `touchpad` folder
2) enter google geocode key instead of "<enter the key>"
You can commit safely all files because all `secret.ts` are ignored. Be careful to not **enter the key in `example.secret.ts`** (which is not ignored)
